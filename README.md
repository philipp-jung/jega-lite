# jenga-lite
Fork of Jenga to focus on tabular data corruptions with the following goals in mind:
- restructuring the repo as a modern poetry project using `Python ^3.10`,
- reducing the number of dependencies,
- removing large binaries from the repository, and
- enforcing dataset formats that contain dtype information rather than working with .csv files.

## Installation
1) Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) on your machine.
2) Clone the repository.
3) Run `poetry install` in the repository's root folder.

## How to use it
